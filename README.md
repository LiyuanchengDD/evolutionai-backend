# evolutionai-backend

This project contains the EvolutionAI backend services implemented with Spring Boot
and gRPC. The gRPC interface definitions live under `src/main/proto` and the
corresponding Java sources are generated by the `protobuf-maven-plugin` during the

`generate-sources` phase. The plugin stays on the widely mirrored 0.6.1 release so
developers do not need extra repositories, and its execution is bound once to
avoid the duplicate runs that previously corrupted generated files on macOS. The
build also adds the generated directories as source folders so IDEs no longer
flag the protobuf classes as missing even before the first build has run.

See the [Front-end Integration Guide](docs/frontend-integration.md) for the
request/response payloads that front-end clients should send to invoke the gRPC
services such as `AuthServiceImpl` and `CandidateServiceImpl`.

## Building the project

```bash
./mvnw clean compile
```

Running `generate-sources` and `compile` in the same Maven invocation is safe. If
your IDE still shows stale errors for generated classes, run `./mvnw

generate-sources` onceâ€”the build-helper configuration keeps those folders
registered afterwards. The build no longer relies on scanning regular dependency
jars for proto files, so standard lifecycle commands such as `./mvnw clean
package` succeed on both macOS and Linux without additional configuration.
