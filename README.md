# evolutionai-backend

This project contains the EvolutionAI backend services implemented with Spring Boot
and gRPC. The gRPC interface definitions live under `src/main/proto` and the
corresponding Java sources are generated by the `protobuf-maven-plugin` during the
`generate-sources` and `compile` phases. The Maven build now pins the code
generation to the `generate-sources` phase and explicitly attaches the generated
directories as source folders so that IDEs no longer flag the protobuf classes as
missing even before the first build has run.

See the [Front-end Integration Guide](docs/frontend-integration.md) for the
request/response payloads that front-end clients should send to invoke the gRPC
services such as `AuthServiceImpl` and `CandidateServiceImpl`.

## Building the project

```bash
./mvnw clean compile
```

Running `generate-sources` and `compile` in the same Maven invocation is safe. If
your IDE still shows stale errors for generated classes, run `./mvnw
generate-sources` onceâ€”the new build-helper configuration keeps those folders
registered afterwards. The build no longer relies on scanning regular dependency
jars for proto files, so standard lifecycle commands such as `./mvnw clean
package` succeed on both macOS and Linux.
