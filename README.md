# evolutionai-backend

This project contains the EvolutionAI backend services implemented with Spring Boot
and gRPC. The gRPC interface definitions live under `src/main/proto` and the
corresponding Java sources are generated by the `protobuf-maven-plugin` during the
`generate-sources` and `compile` phases.

## Building the project

```bash
./mvnw clean compile
```

Running `generate-sources` and `compile` in the same Maven invocation is safe. A
macOS build failure was previously triggered by the protobuf plugin attempting to
scan every regular dependency jar for `.proto` files, which resulted in `Proto path
element is not a directory` errors. The build has been configured to only use the
local proto definitions, so the above command (or any standard Maven lifecycle
command such as `./mvnw clean package`) will now succeed on both macOS and Linux.
